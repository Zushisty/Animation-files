# Animation-files
The files I use to make my YouTube show Tricky Hard Experiences, along with other animations. I didn't upload the Blender and FireAlpaca files because I felt like I didn't need to. I also won't upload any unoriginal audio. The Turbowarp files and images should be enough for people to have fun.
